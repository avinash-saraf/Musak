(CNN) Lionel Messi tells CNN that Paris Saint-Germain is the "ideal" place for him to win the UEFA Champions League once again. During his time with the Catalan giants, Messi won ten Spanish league titles, as well as six Ballon d'Or honors. Just a few days earlier, Messi was in tears during an emotional farewell press conference at Barcelona, the club at which he came through in European football and flourished. Although he admitted in his press conference that his departure from Barcelona was "very hard," he also said that he was "very happy" at his new club and looking forward to the future. "I am aware of my background and the objective this club has -- fighting for a while to win a Champions League, and it was close the last few years," he told CNN.
