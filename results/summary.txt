On Saturday, the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship (ICA) explained the key innovations in the "new and improved" Emirates ID card. The Emirates ID is an identity card issued by the ICA, which is a legal requirement for all UAE citizens and residents. New designs for Emirati passports and Emirates IDs were first announced in November last year after a Cabinet meeting chaired by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai.
